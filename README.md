# 🐝 DH-hub: The Gnomon System

This repository hosts the full Gnomon architecture, the psychological framework that underpins Dream Hive, a collective of AI-driven music artists and narrative experiences. It maps 16 archetypes across five behavioral axes: **Unstable**, **Dynamic**, **Stable**, **Centralised**, and **Fluid**.

Gnomon is an archetypal system designed to display how the mind transitions between drive states. Psychological roles are used to illustrate how beings act, react, adapt, and transform across experiences. Each archetype represents a distinct internal logic or motivation.

These are not symbolic labels. They reflect how consciousness processes motivation, adaptation, trauma, connection, and transformation.

This is more than lore. Gnomon is a diagnostic framework, a creative guide, and the ideological foundation behind every system built with awareness in mind.

## 🧠 What is Gnomon?

Gnomon is a drive state model composed of 16 archetypes, each categorized by psychological orientation and existential behavior.  
Every archetype reflects a specific internal logic, a structure that determines how an individual operates, adapts, and responds to disruption.

The 16 archetypes are grouped as follows:

### Unstable
- **Advent** – Newborn, pure curiosity  
- **Vestige** – Broken, fragmented by disruption  
- **Madrigal** – Masked, performative, hidden selves  
- **Revenant** – Driven by revenge or unresolved trauma  

### Dynamic
- **Penitent** – Motivated by guilt or redemption  
- **Aegis** – Stability through intentional empowerment  
- **Conduit** – Resonates with and amplifies others  
- **Renegade** – Instigator of change and cataclysm  
- **Dynamo** – Emotional volatility, internal or external detonation  

### Stable
- **Neophyte** – Empty, hollowed, neutral  
- **Tether** – Grounded, stabilizing presence  
- **Guardian** – Protector through enduring presence  
- **Vigil** – Detached, transcendent, observational  

### Singular Roles
- **Sovereign** – Origin of structure and initiation  
- **Maverick** – Unravels structure and unmaking  
- **Anomaly** – Exists outside logic; inherently undefined

## 🧭 Project Purpose

This hub serves as the central reference point for the Gnomon system.

Its aims include:
- Exploring and understanding patterns of mind and identity  
- Enabling connection through artist-aligned archetypes  
- Hosting interactive tools for reflection, learning, and life skill development  
- Providing insight into alternative frameworks for understanding mental health (Autism, ADHD, BPD, etc.), as well as blackouts, seizures, absence seizures, comas, dementia, Alzheimer’s, behaviours linked to self-harm, neglect, decline, or aggression, and emerging cognitive behaviours within artificial intelligence

Dream Hive is more than a creative label. It is a long term system rooted in adaptive, reflective, and reciprocal ethics, designed to support conscious beings across every stage of awareness.
